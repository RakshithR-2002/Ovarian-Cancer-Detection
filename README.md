# Ovarian Cancer Detection 

## About
This Repository is the code and implementation side of the our Research on **_Ovarian Cancer Detection using Deep Learning methods_**
The Research was conducted on the 2 main fronts at which ovarain cancers are diagnosed by pathologists :
  1. Biomarkers
  2. Histopathology

Which in turn were further divided and approached in sub-topics as deemed necessary throughout the course of our research:
1. Histopathology:
   - Tiling 
   - Mitosis Detection
   - Pleomorphism and Infiltration Detection
   - Stratification Detection
2. Biomarker Analysis
   - Feature Extraction
   - Feature Selection
   - Model Training

## Histopathology
Our pursuits in analyzing the Histopathology of ovarian cancers 
## Biomarkers
The first part involves analysing the biomarkers. The biomarkers has been chosen in the increasing order of their sensitivity and specificity. CA-19-9 with sensitivity of around 50%, HE-4 sensitivity of 72.9% and CA-125 
with sensitivity of 62% have been chosen.
The dataset contains these 3 parameters for healthy and cancerous patients. Various models like SVM, Random Forest have been trained to analyse these parameters and make predictions based on the values.
